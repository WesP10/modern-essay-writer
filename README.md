# EssayForge Portfolio — Build AI-First Writing Tools with Confidence

Welcome! I'm the creator of EssayForge, a modern AI-assisted writing environment. This README doubles as my hiring pitch and a living snapshot of the product thinking, technical depth, and collaboration style I bring to every engagement.

## Why I'm Different
- **Full-stack delivery mindset:** I own the product experience end-to-end, from interaction design to API contracts and deployment strategy.
- **AI-native pragmatism:** I ship features that make large language models feel trustworthy—transparent UX, guardrails, and human-in-the-loop controls.
- **Design systems fluency:** I can match consumer-grade aesthetics (Google Workspace, VS Code) while keeping component APIs maintainable.

## Core Skills at a Glance
- **Frontend:** SvelteKit, TypeScript, stateful editor experiences, Tiptap, CSS architecture, responsive layout systems.
- **Backend & Infrastructure:** Node.js/Express microservices, API gateway design, Supabase, Redis, rate limiting, observability-first instrumentation.
- **AI/ML Integration:** Prompt engineering, latency-aware autocomplete, AI detection heuristics, model routing via Ollama or hosted LLMs.
- **Product Process:** Discovery workshops, UX prototyping, iterative delivery, documentation habits, async communication.

## Impact Highlights
- Shipped a **VS Code-style panel system** with four AI workspaces (Prompting, Humanizer, Detector, Citations) that are ready for future LLM hookups, complete with resizable layouts, skeleton loaders, and tabbed navigation.【F:docs/PHASE_2_COMPLETE.md†L1-L86】
- Drove a **Google Sheets-inspired editor refresh** that consolidates typography, color, and formatting tooling into an intuitive toolbar without sacrificing accessibility or theming flexibility.【F:docs/UI_UPDATE_COMPLETE.md†L1-L90】
- Authored a **microservices-first backend blueprint** covering autocomplete, AI detection, humanization, and generation pipelines with concrete contracts, performance targets, and caching strategies.【F:docs/BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md†L1-L96】

## Selected Projects
Here’s how I approach complex, AI-augmented writing tools. Each project includes a reusable snapshot you can adapt to future case studies.

### EssayForge AI Workspace
**Description:** A modular writing environment that mirrors VS Code panels while keeping AI interactions transparent and approachable.【F:docs/PHASE_2_COMPLETE.md†L1-L86】  
**Skills Used:**  
- SvelteKit, Tiptap editor, TypeScript-driven state management  
- Responsive CSS architecture, resize observers, accessibility-first component design  
- Product thinking for staged AI rollouts (skeleton loaders, disabled states)  
**Design/Build Process:**  
1. Ideation — mapped the four core AI flows (prompting, humanizing, detection, citations).  
2. Modular prototyping — built panel containers, tab systems, and placeholder UIs as isolated Svelte components.  
3. Testing & iteration — validated drag-resize UX, collapsed states, and keyboard reachability across breakpoints.  
4. Documentation — recorded component structure, interactions, and future AI handoff notes.

### Sheets-Style Editor Refresh
**Description:** A toolbar and navigation overhaul that borrows the familiarity of Google Sheets to reduce cognitive load for academic writers.【F:docs/UI_UPDATE_COMPLETE.md†L1-L90】  
**Skills Used:**  
- Component refactoring, SVG icon systems, custom color pickers  
- UX writing for controls, theming, and state persistence  
- Incremental rollout planning and user education via in-app tips  
**Design/Build Process:**  
1. Ideation — audited existing editor ergonomics and gathered inspiration from Google Workspace patterns.  
2. Modular prototyping — restructured toolbar buttons into semantic groups and added reusable dropdown primitives.  
3. Testing & iteration — validated color palette accessibility, hover states, and dark-mode parity.  
4. Documentation — outlined new interaction patterns and migration guidance for future contributors.

### AI Services Backend Blueprint
**Description:** A production-ready microservices plan that separates autocomplete, detection, humanization, and generation into independently deployable services with a shared gateway.【F:docs/BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md†L1-L96】  
**Skills Used:**  
- Express.js API gateway, rate limiting, authentication  
- Service contract design, JSON schema, caching via Redis, Supabase integration  
- Performance budgeting, observability, and deployment planning  
**Design/Build Process:**  
1. Ideation — defined user-facing AI moments and translated them into discrete service responsibilities.  
2. Modular prototyping — sketched request/response schemas, data contracts, and sequence diagrams.  
3. Testing & iteration — stress-tested latency assumptions, fallback logic, and failure modes through planning exercises.  
4. Documentation — produced living specs for future engineers and stakeholders, including timelines and completion targets.

## How I Work with Teams
- **Product partners:** I translate qualitative insights into prioritized UX improvements and communicate tradeoffs clearly.
- **Engineers:** I document contracts, provide component APIs, and champion maintainable architecture for rapid iteration.
- **Designers:** I obsess over polish, copy, and interaction timing while respecting design system constraints.

## Let’s Build Together
If you’re shipping AI-forward writing or productivity tools and need a builder who can align product, design, and engineering, let’s talk. I bring the craft, curiosity, and documentation rigor to help your team accelerate.
